## 📌 About the Project

**Career Map Generator** is a clean, modular Java application designed to guide users through potential career options based on their interests, education background, and goals. Once a career is selected, the tool generates a roadmap and suggests curated learning resources (courses, certifications, platforms) to help users grow in that direction.

Built with no external dependencies — 100% pure Java (compatible with Java 21), using plain `.txt` files for data.
